# Open Audio Protocol

The **Open Audio Protocol** exists to bring the world's music onchain. It's a community-run, transparent, and open-source repository known as the
**Global Music Database**.

<br />

Originally pioneered in the [2020 Audius Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.audius.co), the Open Audio Protocol marks the next chapter for a music ecosystem powered by `$AUDIO`. The protocol combines blockchain, crypto-economics, and music industry technology standards to deliver new tools for distribution, access, and direct-to-fan freedom.

* **Developers:** you've found a backend for your music app or DSP
* **Artists:** you've found storage and distribution for your works
* **Infra Providers:** you've found opportunity to earn staking rewards by securing the catalog

<br />

The docs ahead cover the core concepts and tutorials needed to get started building with the protocol.
