# Open Audio Protocol

<Orb style={{ height: 200, width: '100%' }} />

The **Open Audio Protocol** exists to bring the world's music onchain. It's a community-run, universally accessible, transparent, and open-source repository we refer to as the \
`Global Music Database`.

Originally pioneered in the [2020 Audius Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.audius.co), the Open Audio Protocol marks the next chapter for a music ecosystem powered by `$AUDIO`. Built on decentralization, the protocol combines blockchain, crypto-economics, and music industry technology standards to deliver new tools for distribution, access, and direct-to-fan freedom.

* *For Developers*, you've found a backend for your music app or DSP
* *For Artists*, you've found storage and distribution for your work
* *For Infra Providers*, you've found an opportunity to earn staking rewards and secure the onchain catalog

The docs ahead cover the core concepts and tutorials needed to get started building with the protocol.
