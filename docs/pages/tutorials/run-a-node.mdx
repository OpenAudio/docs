# Run A Node

This guide shows you how to run a validator node or an RPC node.

:::note
Validators are registered on chain, earn staking rewards, and are required to commit file storage to the network. RPC nodes make data available for off-chain products and do not need to commit file storage.
:::

## Specs

go-openaudio
[code](https://github.com/openaudio/go-openaudio) [releases](https://hub.docker.com/r/openaudio/go-openaudio/tags)


Stable releases are published ~monthly and tagged by their semver. Nightly builds are tagged by commit hash/sha. $AUDIO governance votes on adoption of versions.

go-openaudio is a single docker container that can be run on most hardware with a very minimal set up.

It is recommended to provision a VM with at least:
* 16GB of memory
* 8 cpu cores
* 100GB boot disk
* Datacenter grade network infrastructure

Additionally, validator nodes require file storage. You may elect to use a disk, or any S3-compatible (elastic) blob storage. Generally blob-storage is cheaper given typical workloads.

:::tip
The amount of storage (bytes) you will need to provide can be found via the RPC [storage.v1.StorageService/GetStatus](https://creatornode.audius.co/storage.v1.StorageService/GetStatus).

## Set up

These instructions will show you a minimal `docker compose` set up with an auto-upgrade policy. You may choose your own path instead!

1. First, provision an Ethereum secp256k1 keypair for your node. This key never holds funds.

```bash
pip install eth-keys
python -c "from eth_keys import keys;import os;p=keys.PrivateKey(os.urandom(32));print(p.public_key.to_checksum_address(),p.to_hex())"
```

2. Create a docker compose file
```yaml // [docker-compose.yml]
services:
  my-node:
    image: openaudio/go-openaudio:stable
    container_name: my-node
    environment:
      nodeEndpoint: https://my-node.com
      delegateOwnerWallet: 0x01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef012345
      delegatePrivateKey: 01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef01234567890ab
      spOwnerWallet: 0x01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef012345
      # only set if running a validator node, see section below for blob storage providers
      AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL: s3://my-s3-bucket
      AWS_REGION: us-west-2
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    volumes:
      - /root/audiusd-prod-data:/data
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
      - 26656:26656

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    container_name: watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    command: --cleanup my-node
```

2. Run your node
```
docker compose up -d
```

3. Check your node
```bash
curl my-node.com/health-check
```

:::note
Your node will begin syncing both [core](/concepts/validators#core) data as well as being hosting files using [mediorum](/concepts/validators#mediorum). This process could take a few hours. When it is finished, your node will no longer say syncing

4. Monitor your node and the network

## Blob storage options

Blob storage is configured using the popular [go-cdk](https://gocloud.dev/) library and should work with most blob storage offerings on the market. We have provided some example config below to get started with some commonly used providers.

```bash
# GCP Cloud Storage
#   you will need an additional mount for the credentials
#   i.e. `-v google-application-credentials.json:/tmp/google-application-credentials.json`
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL=gs://my-gcs-bucket
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/google-application-credentials.json

# AWS S3:
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL=s3://my-s3-bucket
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Cloudflare R2:
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL='s3://my-r2-bucket?endpoint=https://abc123def456.r2.cloudflarestorage.com'
AWS_REGION=wnam
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Vultr:
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL='s3://my-vultr-bucket?endpoint=https://sjc1.vultrobjects.com'
AWS_REGION=sjc1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Digital Ocean Spaces:
#    Note: please delete your bucket name from the beginning of the https endpoint URL
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL='s3://my-spaces-bucket?endpoint=https://sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com'
AWS_REGION=sfo3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Backblaze B2:
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL='s3://my-b2-bucket?endpoint=https://s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com'
AWS_REGION=us-west-004
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Moving to blob storage

To move from filesystem storage to blob storage, set the environment variables above to your choosing.

1. Set the env var
```
AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL_MOVE_FROM="file:///tmp/mediorum/blobs?no_tmp_dir=true"
```
2. Restart your node.


You will see this log line:
```
info    Moving all files from file:///tmp/mediorum/blobs?no_tmp_dir=true to s3://my-s3-bucket. This may take a few hours...       
{"node": "https://my-node.com", "service": "mediorum"}
```
When finished, you will this log line:

```
info    Finished moving files between buckets. Please remove AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL_MOVE_FROM from your environment and restart the server. {"node": "https://my-node.com", "service": "mediorum"}
```
:::note
This change will take a few hours.
:::

3. When it completes, or when the target blob storage resembles the expected size, remove `AUDIUS_STORAGE_DRIVER_URL_MOVE_FROM` from your env and restart your node.

4. Any missed files will be re-synced by the mediorum repair job.

## Node registration

A validator node can be registered as soon as it is stood up.

Currently the [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/nodes) offers a simple UI to register nodes. One may also elect to use [etherscan directly](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD17A9bc90c582249e211a4f4b16721e7f65156c8#writeProxyContract) using the `register` function.

Registration requires a minimum bond of 200,000 $AUDIO.

## Migrating from an old stack

### Discovery to validator

1. Spin down your existing node
\
    If using audius-cli
    ```bash
    ssh <your-machine>
    audius-cli down discovery-provider
    ```

    If using audius-ctl
    ```bash
    audius-ctl down discovery.host.com
    ```

2. Follow the instructions above to create a new validator node

3. Re-register your node
> 1. Visit the [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/nodes)
> 2. Authenticate with your wallet
> 3. Click on the node you wish to migrate
> 4. Click the trash can icon to de-register the node, and type DEREGISTER to confirm
> 5. Return to the nodes page of the [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/nodes)
> 6. Click register a new node
> 7. Use the same URL and keypair you previously had used for your node
  

:::warning
If this is your last node, an unstake request will get created. You may cancel it or simply ignore it.
:::

### Content to validator

Existing content nodes, if running a recent `audiusd` or `go-openaudio` image, qualify as validator nodes. Content nodes have a smaller maximum stack allowance than validator nodes though, so it is beneficial to re-register them. It is also highly recommended that you move your node to blob storage if it is running off of a disk.

To re-register your node:

Deregister your existing node
1. Visit the [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/nodes)
2. Authenticate with your wallet
3. Click on the node you wish to migrate
4. Click the trash can icon to de-register the node, and type DEREGISTER to confirm
5. Return to the nodes page of the [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/nodes)
6. Shut down your existing content node

Use the new image
7. Update the environment variable `creatorNodeEndpoint` to be `nodeEndpoint`
8. Set the image from audiusd to `openaudio/go-openaudio:stable`

Register a new code
9. Click register a new node
10. Use the same URL and keypair you previously had used for your node
11. Spin your node back up

:::warning
If this is your last node, an unstake request will get created. You may cancel it or simply ignore it.
