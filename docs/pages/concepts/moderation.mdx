# Moderation

Validator nodes specify a moderation party to adhere to guidance from. Moderation parties exist to meet [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) and other content moderation needs. When content is uploaded to the protocol, moderation parties may freely access content, provided that they are specified by the hosting validator nodes.

Tiki Labs, Inc. offers a free US-based, closed source fingerprinting library that makes use of modern tooling used across the music industry. Tiki Labs, Inc.'s moderation party identifier (a `secp256k1` address) is set as the default in the go-openaudio implementation.
