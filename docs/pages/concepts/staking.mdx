# Staking

There are two ways to stake \$AUDIO:
* Directly staking through the [Staking.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe6D97B2099F142513be7A2a068bE040656Ae4591) contract by registering a `validator node`
* Delegating \$AUDIO stake through the [DelegateManager.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d7968ebfD390D5E7926Cb3587C39eFf2F9FB225) contract to an existing `validator` (node operator) of the protocol.

This way, anyone can stake \$AUDIO, no matter how much or how little.

\$AUDIO stakers earn a share of the protocol's 7% annual reward rate, distributed proportionally across all staked tokens. Rewards are claimable weekly and can be claimed by any staker or delegator, ensuring a fully permissionless process that prevents deadlocks.

Staking is instant, while unstaking requires a 7-day cooldown, allowing governance proposals to complete before funds are withdrawn.

## Direct Staking

Operating a `validator node` requires a minimum stake of 200,000 \$AUDIO, with a maximum bond limit of 15,000,000 \$AUDIO per node. Stake is held at the `validator` account level and is spread across all nodes that they operate.

For example, if a `validator` themselves is staking 400,000 \$AUDIO and receiving a delegation of 700,000 \$AUDIO, they may run between 1 and 5 nodes. If a `validator` is staking 1,000,001 \$AUDIO and receiving 14,000,000 in delegation, they must run at least 2 nodes.

`Validators` choose the parameters to receive delegation:
* The percentage fee of rewards they capture from all delegated \$AUDIO
* The minimum amount of stake an individual party is permitted to delegate to them

## Delegate Staking

Users may wish to provide economic security to the protocol, but be unable to provide hardware directly themselves to operate a node. Therefore, they may choose to delegate stake to another existing validator on the network.

Delegators must satisfy the minimum delegation amount set by their chosen validator and share in any reductions in stake resulting from slashing or penalties due to validator negligence.

Delegator rewards are earned and claimed in the same transactions as when the validator they are staked to claims rewards.

## Slashing

Negligent validators whose nodes do not meet their obligations can be slashed. Slashing is performed through the [Governance](/concepts/governance) system after sufficient vote and tokens that are slashed are burned through the null address.

Further details on automated mechanicsms can be read in the [Validators](/concepts/validators#sla-proofs) section.
